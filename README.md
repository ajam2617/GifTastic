# GifTastic
Use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of your choice by calling the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of your site.

#How it works
Type in any word that describes how you are feeling, and click submit. A button is created with the word submitted. Click any button and still GIFs will populate. Click a GIF to animate it. Click a GIF again to make it still. 

#Issues
I could not figure out how to put spacing between the buttons. I tried to add some additional terms from bootstrap into my JS function that creates the buttons with classes, but it didn't work. I also tried to add some padding, which only changed the distance between the buttons and the "h1" and the "display buttons" div.
